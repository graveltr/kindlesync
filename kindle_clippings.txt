But for Megan, quitting was the easy part. The more difficult task was figuring out who she was when she wasn’t working. For two decades, there had always been an article marinating in the back of her mind. Her life had run on journalism’s clock; editors set her deadlines, and then, when she became one, Megan set deadlines for her staff. Most of her friends were journalists. When she wasn’t at her day job, she volunteered as the director of the Princeton Summer Journalism Program, an intensive seminar for low-income high school students. Journalism wasn’t just her livelihood; it was her life. “I’ve always defined myself by my work, which means this transition has been far harder than I ever expected,” Megan told me a few weeks after leaving Wired. “I’m flailing because I don’t know who I am.”

As she was growing up, Megan’s parents were both contractors—her dad in flooring and her mom in window coverings. Megan and her younger sister went to eight different schools between kindergarten and high school, as her parents moved the family up and down the West Coast in search of stable work. Megan says she had a bit of an obsessive personality, and she latched on to activities during different phases of her youth. In first and second grade, she entered national essay-writing contests. In middle school, she was an avid musical theater kid. In eighth grade, she became a competitive fencer. “I was super driven by external achievement and external recognition,” she told me. Journalism, a career that provides a constant drip of urgency, competition, and recognition, was a natural fit.

Ezra Fox, a video producer who was let go after seven years during a company reorganization, told me, “It’s hard when you get information from the world that goes against one of the central narratives of your life.” Ezra had conceived of himself as someone who was successful, a narrative that was reinforced by years of good grades and promotions. But being laid off spurred an internal reckoning for him. He couldn’t reconcile the story that he was “successful” with someone who had just lost his job.

Social scientist Arthur Brooks argues that we’re good at ascribing meaning to the narrative arc of our lives, but are often ill-equipped to react if the script changes. Breaks in the script—such as retirement, a sabbatical, or a round of mass layoffs—test our resilience. They require us to edit or, in some cases, throw out the old script altogether. But these breaks also provide us with an opportunity to start a new one from scratch.

“When you hit the bottom and you aren’t producing or contributing in any of the ways society expects and capitalism demands, you look around and ask: Do I have value?” she told me. But with the help of the disability community, Liz was able to build other pillars of value beyond her output. So even if one pillar were to crumble, her foundation would remain. Perhaps the most American “I am” label is “a producer.” Workers are measured by their productivity, companies are measured by their growth, and the country’s health is measured by its GDP. We celebrate those deemed to be “productive members of society” and call those who rely on social services “welfare queens” and “freeloaders.” But it isn’t just our country or employer that imposes this value system on us. Using productivity to measure worth is a standard we also impose on ourselves. And in the process, many Americans have internalized the values of our dominant economic system: capitalism.

Goal-oriented hobbies like signing up for a marathon or reading a certain number of books in a year can provide accountability to do things outside of work. But striving for a goal still imposes a frame of improvement, which implies work in a fundamental sense. This isn’t to say these types of hobbies are bad. But I can’t help thinking that, through all of our quantified ambition, we lose sight of the wisdom we all knew as children: the joy of play.

The Experiment has three precepts. First, Josh accepts only work that he finds meaningful. Second, he accepts only work that pays well (his rate is $130 an hour). And third, he accepts only work that allows him to work less than twenty hours a week. Most weeks Josh works ten to fifteen hours, but his annual income hovers around six figures. Rather than leverage his expertise for more money, as is customary for most ambitious professionals, he’s chosen to leverage his expertise for more time.

The word itself derives from the Latin word “licere,” or “to be permitted to abstain from occupation or service.” Athenians thought leisure was “the highest value of life” and would devote entire days to creating art, playing sports, and contemplating the nature of existence. Aristotle believed leisure, not work, was “the goal of all human behavior, the end toward which all action is directed.”

After high school, Josh attended Northern Virginia Community College for two years before transferring to Virginia Commonwealth University, which brought him to Richmond. He figured a college diploma might be useful down the line, though pursuing a career wasn’t particularly important to him. For two years, he worked “as one of those people who waved the little glow sticks” for United Airlines at the Richmond airport. He worked five night shifts a week, from four p.m. until the last plane arrived after midnight. He was paid $10 an hour with no overtime, even when flights were delayed into the early morning. At the end of every shift, he switched on the flickering headlight of his bike and rode the thirty-five minutes home. This is just not cutting it, he thought.

Mainstream depictions of overwork often feature business executives checking emails on vacation or Silicon Valley entrepreneurs coding late into the night. In the U.S. at least, busyness is more often valorized than disparaged. The gig platform Fiverr, for example, ran a 2017 ad campaign praising those who “eat a coffee for lunch” and choose “sleep deprivation as their drug of choice.”

This was “vacation Josh.” But after those first two weeks, he started to feel uncomfortable. “For the last seven years, I had interpreted that all the time in my day had to translate to economic value,” he told me. “And so when I couldn’t look back at my days and see an economic output, I started to feel like my days weren’t valuable.”

As Loretta Graziano Breuning writes in her book Status Games: Why We Play and How to Stop, “In the state of nature, social comparison has life-or-death consequences, so natural selection built a brain that responds to social comparisons with life-or-death brain chemistry.” Our brains reward us with serotonin when we achieve higher status. But serotonin is released in short spurts and quickly metabolized. As the initial rush fades, we seek more and more.

“We seek status because we don’t know our own preferences,” Agnes Callard, a philosopher at the University of Chicago, told me. “When we don’t trust our own definition of what is good, we let other people define it for us.” Callard clarified that this isn’t always a bad thing. Totems of status, like awards and recognition, can motivate us to achieve. But when we assume others’ values as our own, we undermine our autonomy. Instead of determining our own definition of success, we buy one off the rack.

“If you could go, but you couldn’t tell anyone that you went, would you still do it?” I was so grateful for that question. For the first time, it made me consider my intrinsic motivation. Was I actually interested in learning, or just in being someone with a graduate degree? I decided to go, and I’m glad that I did. But if not for Robin’s question, I may have never taken the time to ask what, irrespective of others’ perceptions, mattered to me.

Choosing a career based solely on one’s desires without considering what the market values can, for example, lead people to assume great amounts of debt for schooling that might not lead to practical job prospects. It can lead to situations in which artists can’t focus on their art because they live in a constant state of anxiety about how they’ll make rent. But alternatively, a career choice solely based on the demands of the market, without considering the demands of one’s heart, can lead to situations in which people spend their lives climbing ladders they never wanted to be on in the first place. Even if you are passionate about what you do, the urge to climb the career ladder’s endless rungs can taint the intrinsic rewards of what drew you to a particular line of work in the first place.

The key is to craft a personal definition of success that takes into account what you value and what the market values—in the words of theologian Frederick Buechner, to figure out “where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.” Certainly, Khe’s financial situation helped him design a beautiful life, but there’s another ingredient that contributes to his peace of mind—the lack of which keeps some of the richest Wall Street bankers from ever feeling fulfilled. Khe has cultivated an appetite for what he already has. He understands his personal definition of good enough.

One of the main issues with overwork is that many of us have internalized the hustle culture that surrounds us. While I was writing this book, there was no boss mandating when I should or shouldn’t work. I told myself that I wasn’t going to let the writing process take over my life, that I would build periods of rest into my weeks. But despite all that, I still teetered on the edge of burnout. The problem with self-imposed boundaries is that they’re permeable. It was too easy to let my fear of not finishing the manuscript on time or the feeling that I didn’t deserve a break stop me from honoring my intentions. In the words of author James Clear, “It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.”

Furthermore, overwork is a systemic issue—one that is the result of economic, political, and cultural factors—and thus there are limits to individual interventions. All too often, the onus to carve out and protect space for our nonwork selves falls on workers. Common antiburnout advice like “set a boundary” or “practice self-care” crumbles without institutional support behind it. If your company is understaffed, or it’s the end of a quarter, or your pay is tied to your hours, setting a personal boundary is like trying to shield yourself from the sun with a cocktail umbrella.

I was recently interviewing Adam Haar Horowitz, a researcher at MIT who studies sleep and dreams, when he asked me to try an experiment. “Picture yourself trying to fall asleep in a hotel room,” he said. Easy enough, I thought. “Okay, now picture yourself trying to fall asleep in a hotel room with the door wide open.” Immediately, my entire body tensed. There was certainly no way I could fall asleep when a deranged clown might walk in at any moment. In order to rest and, by extension, to dream, we first need to feel safe. If we don’t, our mammalian minds will keep part of our brains alert to scan for threats. I think a similar biological force drives my tendency to overwork. Despite my gainful employment and the support systems around me, I still fear, however irrationally, that I’ll lose my livelihood—or at least lose my career momentum.

I began this book with a simple question: what do you do? I want to end with a suggestion for how we might amend this canonical piece of American small talk. All it takes is adding two small words. “What do you like to do?” It’s a question that allows you to define yourself on your own terms. Maybe you like to read fiction. Maybe you like to cook Mediterranean food. Maybe you like to watercolor or to write. Maybe you do those things for work. Maybe you don’t. Maybe that’s good enough.

Until I bought that plane ticket, you could have characterized my path in life as what former Yale English professor William Deresiewicz calls being a “world-class hoop jumper.” In a now famous commencement speech, Deresiewicz observed how many of his students had been trained to achieve any goal set out for them. They could memorize any formula, ace any test, and “climb the greasy pole of whatever hierarchy they decide to attach themselves to.” While ambitious and high achieving, they were “trapped in a bubble of privilege, heading meekly in the same direction.” As one of Deresiewicz’s students put it, Yale students were “excellent sheep.”
